Build a content scraper project for the Treehouse tech degree

I have checked my code in jshint and have verified that it is free of any syntax errors.

## Extra Credit

- [X] Use a linting tool like ESLint to check your code for syntax errors and to ensure general code quality. You should be able to run npm run lint to check your code.

- [X] When an error occurs log it to a file scraper-error.log . It should append to the bottom of the file with a time stamp and error e.g. [Tue Feb 16 2016 10:02:12 GMT-0800 (PST)] <error message>
